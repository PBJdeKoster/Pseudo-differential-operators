We use windons and python.

To set up and be able to run everything, we install a virtual environment to ensure the correct versions are used.
Follow the following steps

1) Clone the main branch into a desired folder

2) Create a virtual environment using git bash:
" python -m venv venv "

3) Activate the virtual environment:
" source venv/Source/activate"
